142,142,"8 June – A paper challenges the public perception and media depictions of large language models like especially ChatGPT, arguing that ""bullshitting"" in the sense of the book On Bullshit and a fundamentally flawed design are a better approach or terminology for understanding the flaws of these AI architectures or the behavior of the systems based on these as opposed to occasional or frequent ""hallucinations"". In agreement with many other experts, they find these models are in an ""important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs"". This notion has also been applied to Perplexity AI that is typically used for generating outputs that are less inaccurate than ChatGPT's – or contain fewer ""hallucinations"" – and which was scaled up substantially during 2024. An investigation by WIRED reportedly showed the chatbot at times closely paraphrased WIRED stories, and at times summarized stories inaccurately and with minimal attribution. Approaches to mitigate inaccurate information and hallucinations include the use of retrieval-augmented generation and ""grounding"" by configuring the corpus to be used by the AI which is used for example in the open source chatbot ""WikiChat"" that essentially prevents the hallucinations by retrieving facts only from a multilingual Wikipedia corpus, thereby providing a novel way to use Wikipedias. On 12 August, researchers demonstrate a open source 'AI Scientist' which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, and writes a final research paper in the field of machine learning evaluated by an automated reviewer. The authors of the preprint advise ""treating generated papers as hints of promising ideas for practitioners to follow up on"". On 11 May, a study shows that 52% of ChatGPT answers to 517 programming questions on Stack Overflow contain incorrect information and 77% are verbose where study participants still preferred ChatGPT answers 35% of the time but also overlooked the misinformation in the ChatGPT answers 39% of the time.","[-0.02926025  0.02123905  0.01273109 ... -0.01779747 -0.00944034
