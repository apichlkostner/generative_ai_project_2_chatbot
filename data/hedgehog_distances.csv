Their spines are not poisonous or barbed and, unlike the quills of a porcupine, do not easily detach from their bodies. However, the immature animal's spines normally fall out as they are replaced with adult spines. This is called ""quilling"". Spines can also shed when the animal is diseased or under extreme stress.
