In agreement with many other experts, they find these models are in an \"important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs\". This notion has also been applied to Perplexity AI that is typically used for generating outputs that are less inaccurate than ChatGPT\\'s – or contain fewer \"hallucinations\" – and which was scaled up substantially during 2024. An investigation by WIRED reportedly showed the chatbot at times closely paraphrased WIRED stories, and at times summarized stories inaccurately and with minimal attribution. Approaches to mitigate inaccurate information and hallucinations include the use of retrieval-augmented generation and \"grounding\" by configuring the corpus to be used by the AI which is used for example in the open source chatbot \"WikiChat\" that essentially prevents the hallucinations by retrieving facts only from a multilingual Wikipedia corpus, thereby providing a novel way to use Wikipedias. On 12 August, researchers demonstrate a open source \\'AI Scientist\\' which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, and writes a final research paper in the field of machine learning evaluated by an automated reviewer. The authors of the preprint advise \"treating generated papers as hints of promising ideas for practitioners to follow up on\". On 11 May, a study shows that 52% of ChatGPT answers to 517 programming questions on Stack Overflow contain incorrect information and 77% are verbose where study participants still preferred ChatGPT answers 35% of the time but also overlooked the misinformation in the ChatGPT answers 39% of the time.\\n10 June – A study finds African elephants use personal name-like calls to address one another.\\n11 June – Scientists report that serious kidney disease may be associated with human spaceflight.\\n12 June\\nA study links the apparent gap in life expectancy between male and female organisms to reproductive cells driving sex-dependent differences in lifespan and suggests a role for vitamin D in improving longevity.\\nThe Economist reports that China has become a \"scientific superpower\", citing numerous examples of its rapid development across a wide range of fields.\\n20 June – Following a surge in population of the Iberian lynx – from 62 mature individuals in 2001 to 648 in 2022 – the International Union for Conservation of Nature removes the animal from its \"endangered\" list, classing the animal as \"vulnerable\" instead.\\n24 June – The discovery of three Super-Earth candidates around HD 48948, a K-type dwarf star located 55 light-years away, is reported.
